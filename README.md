# LozengeTiling
A program that uses coupling from the past to generate lozenge tilings.

## Dependancies
This program uses [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) as its graphics engine.

## How to Use
Run `Visualizer.py`. To exit, hit the \[x\] button or press esc. The default tiling size is 20, but that can be changed at the top of `GenerateTiling.py`.
